## API Deployment

For hackathon and external review, deploy the API to a public host (e.g., Railway or Render) and expose:

- Base API URL
- `/docs` OpenAPI page
- `/health` endpoint

## Docs Deployment (TanStack Start + Fumadocs)

Inside `docs/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Host the generated app on your platform of choice. Ensure the published URL is added to your root `README.md`.

### API Reference (Scalar)

The docs site includes an interactive OpenAPI reference at `/docs/openapi` (Scalar), with try-it-out and environment switching (Local / Production). To point it at your deployed API, set when building the docs:

```bash
VITE_FLUX_API_URL=https://your-flux-api.example.com npm run build
```

## Production Checklist

- Environment variables configured on host
- Secrets rotated and never committed
- Error responses sanitized
- Public docs URL verified
- API quickstart examples tested against deployed URL
