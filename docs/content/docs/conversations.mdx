title: Conversation API
description: Stateful, context-aware multi-turn retrieval and synthesis.

## Design Intent

The conversation API preserves context across turns so follow-up queries can be interpreted correctly without requiring client-side prompt stitching.

Example:

1. "What is SVB?"
2. "Why did it collapse?"
3. "What was the federal response?"

Turn 2 and 3 are resolved using prior context.

## Endpoints

### `POST /conversations`

Creates a new conversation object.

### `GET /conversations?page=1&page_size=20`

Returns paginated conversation summaries.

### `GET /conversations/{id}`

Returns the full conversation with messages and retrieval artifacts.

### `POST /conversations/{id}/messages`

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "why did it collapse"
}
```

Behavior:

- Uses recent prior queries to build retrieval context.
- Reranks using the current query intent.
- Synthesizes an answer with citations from top-ranked sources.
- Persists message + citations + selected retrieval results.

### `DELETE /conversations/{id}`

Deletes conversation state and returns `204`.

## Operational Notes

- Conversation storage is in-memory by default.
- Data resets on server restart unless persistence is added.
- For production, replace in-memory store with durable storage.
